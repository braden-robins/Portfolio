                    <h1>First Design:</h1>
                    <p>My first design is based off a wide range of colours, similar to a temperature diagram. I found some art that matched this idea and brought it to life.</p>

                    <h1>Second Design:</h1>
                    <p>This design was more pastel themed. I had seen then pastel fruits in water on pintrest, and those colours were just perfect, so I used those as refrence for this design.</p>

                    <h1>Third Design:</h1>
                    <p>This design’s theme was space, so if you’ve seen the moodboard, there were things like black holes, sunsents, etc. That was my idea for this design.</p>

                    <h1>Final Design:</h1>
                    <p>I chose design 1 as my final design. This design was the most uniform, interesting, and eyecatching of the three. I like this design because it feels vintage and has a calming feeling to it. One of my friends mentioned it reminded her of a tomato garden and truely that’s all I can invision now. I really like this design and home to one day make it real, this is my final design for my assessment on designing an art blog.</p>
