                    <p>This really efficient yet confusing code is what asks the questions to the user and clarifies if they are correct or incorrect. This may seem unreadable but with a bit a little bit of staring, it’ll start to make a lot more sense. </p>

                    <h1>The Code's Result:</h1>
                    <p>This is how my final assessment code looks like in action. It introduced the code and gives the student options of subjects. Once the student has chosen, it explains all the rules required for this subject. We’re then allowed to chose how many questions to answer, and we’re informed if our answers are correct or incorrect. In the end it tells you how many you got right, and if you want to study more.</p>
