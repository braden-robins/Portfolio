                    <h1>Trial Website HTML:</h1>
                    <p>We first started with learning some basic structure. We learnt how to yse headers from size 1 to 6, we learnt how to use a p tag (paragraph tag), we learnt how to use a br tag (break), we learnt how to reference a website to create a button, and we learnt how to add on image. It was a bit confusing at first but near the end things started to make sense. This was our first website's html.</p>
                </div>
            </div> 
            <div class="content">
                <div class="text">
                    <h1>Trial Website CSS:</h1>
                    <p>Now it was time to add the CSS. We learnt how to add classes (names essentially) to each section in our html. This allowed us to add CSS to individual aspects of our code. We learnt how to align items, change font weight, size, and style, how to add colour, and how to move things around with margin and padding. What you see on the right is the result of that.</p>

                    <h1>Trial Website 2 Code:</h1>
                    <p>Now things were getting serious and we were on the brink of getting ready for our assignment. Our teacher helped us to create a base template for the banner and the navigation, but customization was up to us. I added quite a bit of my own CSS and HTML, to add colour and give the website more personality.</p>
                </div>
            </div> 
            <div class="content">
                <div class="text">
                    <h1>Trial Website 2 Result:</h1>
                    <p>This was the result of the above code. You can see me trying to be funny by making it themed around “Pain and Suffering”, truely this was a joke so I could make the website all pastel and cute themed. I think in the end it turned out quite well, the straw berry theme made the red pop and helped me understand how to balance elements and colours, going back to the conventions we learnt about during our design assignment.</p>
