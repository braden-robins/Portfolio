                    <h1>Assesment Basics:</h1>
                    <p>Essentially the goal of this assessment was to create a portfolio of all the work we've done in digital tech since the start of the year. We were allowed to add more about ourselves but i decided to make it mainly focused on my work.</p>

                    <h1>Specifications:</h1>
                    <p>These would help us make decisions for our website. The three i had were that it should use atleast 3 colours, one ideally red or teal with brown, I also wanted 7 pages (two for each topic and a home page), and I wanted detailed steps for each topic, so explaining the process and the final result.</p>

                    <h1>Color Scheme:</h1>
                    <p>I ended up going for the teal and brown, with an orange instead of a red. This paired with an almost black grey helped create the colour scheme for my website. It'd become that each color would represent a topic.</p>

                    <h1>Base Plan:</h1>
                    <p>This was the basic layout I wanted for each page. The home page would be short and have all three of the subject colours incorporated, and the other pages would be coloured according to subject, I made two pages per subject as I mentioned in my specifications. I also added the header and navigation to the design to give me an idea of how much space I'll have left for content.</p>

                    <h1>Final Design:</h1>
                    <p>I added all the content onto the page with filler text to help me visualize what it’d look like. I added buttons to each subject on the home page as well as an introduction and fake contact details. You’re currently using the final result of this assignment! This website is the result for hours of work to make this design come to life and now it’s complete. I added spacing in between content to make it easier to read and make the website more open and free. I believe my website turned out very similar to my design, almost identical. There are a few differences though, lets see if you can spot them!</p>
