                    <p> We first started by learning the basics of Python and how to use it at all. </p>
                    <h1>Detailed Questions:</h1>
                    <p>We learnt a bit about how to ask basic questions you would see in any sort of code you might find. This was useful to gather information and allow up to learn how to put that into affect. It taught up how to use “print(“”)”, and other things such as “int(input(“”))”, which would be cruetial during our final assessment. We also learned about “if:” and “else:” which is quiet helpful in eliminating the users answers. Numbers were also a key in this, we learned how to do math in python with values given by the user.</p>

                    <h1>While & While True:</h1>
                    <p>We learnt how to use while and while true, which is going to be very helpful to loop and run each question in final code. During this particulas lesson we also leant how to import “random”. It’s essentially like a randomizer.</p>

                    <h1>Determinging a Triangle:</h1>
                    <p>This code is personally one of my favourites, it was a task to get inputs from the user of the side lengths of a triangle and to determine from those numbers whether it is scaline, equilateral or isoceles. Essentially focusing on learning “int(input(“”))” and “if:”, “else:”, and “elif:”.</p>

                    <h1>Password and Username:</h1>
                    <p>Another quite common thing you’d find in websites of anything digital really is a password and username input. So here we learnt how to do just that. Letting them set a username and password, seeing if they can remember it, and giving them the constrain of 3 attempts. It was a simple code really, but helped up learn restrictions, loops, and comparisons.</p>

                    <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors:</h1>
                    <p>This one is truely fun to play, I had attempted this one but failed, so the one benign shown is the one written by our teacher. From his code we can see the sheer complexity of what seems like a simple game. Personally I had quite fun trying to attempt this one, but in the end it was surprisingly challenging.</p>
